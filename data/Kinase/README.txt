This dataset consists of 3,365 kinase protein structures with either active or
inactive conformations. Determining the activity of kinase structures is valuable
in understanding the regulatory mechanism of kinases. While very similar in
overall structure, subtle differences between the structures' binding site
conformation is the main determinant of kinase activity. Statistics about
sequence length and structure diameter can be found in graph.summary.
