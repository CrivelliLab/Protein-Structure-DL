The 'PsiBlast' dataset contains protein structures returned from a PsiBlast
search using Ras sequences. This set was generated to test the ability of
classifying between Ras structures and structures that closely resemble Ras,
but do not belong to the family. Statistics about sequence
length and structure diameter can be found in graph.summary.
