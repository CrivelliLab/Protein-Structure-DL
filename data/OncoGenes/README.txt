This dataset is composed of 2,314 structures belonging to two different classes
of proteins, tumor suppression genes (TSGs) and proto-oncogenes (OGs), whose
regulatory mechanisms play major roles in the suppression and growth of tumors
respectively. Identification of structures with similar functionality to TSGs
and OGs is valuable to the development of cancer treatments which target these
two genes. Statistics about sequence length and structure diameter can be found
in graph.summary.
